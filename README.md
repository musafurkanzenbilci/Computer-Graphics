# C++ Raytracing

This repository contains a raytracing project implemented in C++. The project generates photorealistic images by tracing the path of light as pixels and simulating the interactions of the light with virtual objects in a 3D scene.

## Features

- Support for different types of shapes such as spheres, planes and triangles
- Support for different types of materials such as diffuse, glossy and transparent.
- Support for different lighting models such as Phong and Cook-Torrance 
- Support for global illumination techniques such as path tracing and bidirectional path tracing.
- Additional features such as texture mapping, reflections, refractions and depth of field.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE and build the project.
3. Run the project and explore the different features and options available.
4. Adjust the parameters and settings to generate different images and compare the results.
